# pibackup
**Version:** v1.4.1 

**pibackup** is a portable 64-bit backup and restore tool with a graphical user interface (GUI), specially designed for Raspberry Pi and similar Linux systems.
Unlike typical SD card tools, it is optimized for large storage devices like SSDs and HDDs, but also works seamlessly with smaller devices.
It creates backups of the first two partitions of any storage device and offers flexible, selective restoration.
After creating a backup, pibackup automatically removes specified files and folders from the image, shrinks it, and compresses it efficiently using **Zstandard (.zst)** to save space.

Safe and Flexible Restore:
By default, pibackup overwrites only the first two partitions of the target device during restoration. Other partitions and their data remain untouched ‚Äì unless you choose to delete them during the restore process to free up space.
Additionally, you can optionally change the device ID (MBR disk signature) during restore to avoid conflicts when using multiple cloned devices.

## Main Features

- **Simple graphical user interface (GUI)**
- No installation required ‚Äì runs directly
- 64-bit application for Linux
- Automatically backs up the first two partitions (typically `/boot` and `/root`) of the selected device
- Flexible removal of unwanted files and folders via a freely configurable **exclude file**
- Optional removal of SSH and DHCP configurations from the backup
- Shrinks the image after creation to optimize storage usage
- Efficient compression using **zstd**
- Allows saving to other partitions on the same drive
- The uncompressed .img backup file remains available and is not deleted if the checkbox is left unchecked or if the compression process fails.
- Compressed backups can be created directly as `.img.zst` and used for restoration
- Supports SD cards, SSDs, HDDs, and other block devices

## Restore Features

- Direct restore from **`.img`** or **`.img.zst`** files ‚Äì no manual decompression needed
- Target device selection via a **drop-down list**
- Target partition size adjustable via a **scrollbar**:
  - Range between the minimum image size and the maximum available storage
- Preview of the planned target partition layout:
  - Displayed in a **grid** showing how the drive will look after restoration
  - Shows partition tables, sizes, types, etc.
  - The grid updates dynamically when adjusting the target size
- Existing partitions remain intact
- Optional deletion of **selected** partitions before restore
- Backup is written directly to the chosen partition without overwriting others (except when deletion is enabled)
- Automatically adjusts the filesystem to fit the size of the partition.
- Alternatively, you can set the desired size manually using a slider.

## Graphical Interface

- Clear, self-explanatory GUI
- Select device via drop-down list
- Partition preview via grid display
- Progress indication during backup and restore
- Clear status and error messages

## Exclude File

The **exclude file** is a configurable text file containing a list of files and folders to remove from the image.  
This allows the backup to be cleaned of unnecessary or temporary data to save storage space and reduce image size.

### Exclude File Format

- Each line contains a path (absolute from the root filesystem of the partition) to exclude.
- Wildcards (e.g., `*`) are **not recommended**. Instead, use existing commands to delete multiple files or directories.
- Comments or empty lines are ignored.
- For examples, refer to the existing exclude files.
- For initial usage, use the raspberry.exclude file.


## Usage

Start the application using the provided launch script:

    /path/to/pibackup/start_pibackup.sh

This script:

- Launches `pibackup` with `sudo` and required environment variables
- Runs the application in the background
- Closes the terminal window automatically after launching

You can start it:
- From a terminal, by typing:
  
      /path/to/pibackup/start_pibackup.sh

- By double-clicking the script in a file manager (make sure it is executable)
- Or via a `.desktop` launcher

## Desktop Launcher
To launch PiBackup from the desktop or applications menu, you can create a `.desktop` file:

#### Example: `PiBackup.desktop`

```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Name=PiBackup
Comment=Start the PiBackup tool
Exec=/home/pi/PiBackup/start_pibackup.sh
Icon=utilities-terminal
Terminal=true
Type=Application
Categories=Utility;
```

#### Instructions:

1. Save this content as a file named `PiBackup.desktop` in your home folder or on the desktop:

    `/home/pi/Desktop/PiBackup.desktop`

2. Make the file executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x /home/pi/Desktop/PiBackup.desktop
    ```

3. Optional: If you want to use a custom icon, replace the `Icon=` line with:

    ```ini
    Icon=/home/pi/PiBackup/icon.png
    ```

4. You can also copy the file to `~/.local/share/applications/` to make it appear in the main applications menu.

This launcher uses the `start_pibackup.sh` script, which starts the backup application with the necessary privileges and closes the terminal automatically.

Tip: Make sure both files are executable:
 ```bash
    chmod +x start_pibackup.sh
    chmod +x pibackup
```
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**  
> Adjust the `Exec=` and `Icon=` paths if your project is located in a different directory.  
> For example, replace `/home/pi/PiBackup/` with your actual installation path.


##In the GUI:

- Select the device to back up
- Choose target partition and storage location
- Optionally specify an exclude file
- Start the backup process

The tool creates:

- A full **.img** file
- An additional **.img.zst** compressed backup

If you wish, both files remain available. The uncompressed .img file is not deleted if the checkbox is unchecked or compression is unsuccessful.

Restore works directly from both file types.

## Requirements

- No installation required
- `zstd` must be installed (`sudo apt install zstd`)
- Root privileges required (start via `sudo`)

## Build Information

* The application was developed using **CodeTyphon** ([https://www.pilotlogic.com/](https://www.pilotlogic.com/)).
* **Qt5** widgetset was used for the GUI.
* Compilation target: **64-bit ARM Linux**.

### Building from source

```bash
# Use CodeTyphon IDE
# Set widgetset to Qt5  - may needs recompiling CodeTyphon IDE
# Compile as 64-bit ARM Linux application
```
